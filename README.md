  `sudo apt install imagemagick` or `brew install imagemagick` (for MacOS) to install imagemagick.
  - You need an IGDB API key, you can get one [here](https://www.igdb.com/api).
  - Create a file named `config.js` in `backend/igdb` with the api key as export.   
  `module.exports = {
    api_key: your-api-key
  }`
  - Generate keys with `node generateKeypair.js`.
  - To start the backend run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
- Frontend
